## üì¶ What Are Containers?

Containers offer a lightweight alternative to virtual machines. They share the host OS kernel and isolate application processes with just the necessary dependencies.

### Key Characteristics:

* ü™∂ **Lightweight**: No need for a full OS per container
* üöÄ **Fast startup**
* üì¶ **Package once, run anywhere**
* üîÅ **Efficient resource utilization**

  ## üê≥ Introduction to Docker

Docker is the most widely adopted containerization platform.

### How Docker Works:

1. Write a `Dockerfile` describing your app and environment
2. Run `docker build` to create a Docker image
3. Run `docker run` to launch a container from the image

```bash
# Example Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
COPY app.py /app/app.py
CMD ["python", "/app/app.py"]
```

### Docker Lifecycle:

```text
Dockerfile -> Docker Image -> Docker Container
```

### Commands:

```bash
# Build an image
$ docker build -t myapp:latest .

# Run a container
$ docker run -d myapp:latest
```

## üèóÔ∏è Container vs Virtual Machine Architecture

| Feature             | Virtual Machine     | Container             |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| OS                  | Full OS per VM      | Shared host OS kernel |
| Startup Time        | Minutes             | Seconds               |
| Image Size          | GBs                 | MBs                   |
| Isolation           | Strong (hypervisor) | Moderate (namespace)  |
| Resource Efficiency | Lower               | Higher                |


**Docker Lifecycle & Architecture**

**Docker Lifecycle**:

**1.	Write a Dockerfile**

A file that defines the steps to containerize an application.

**2.	Build a Docker Image**

Convert the Dockerfile into an image using docker build.

**3.	Run a Docker Container**

Create a running instance using docker run.

**4.	Push to Docker Registry**

Share the Docker image using docker push.

**Docker Architecture:**

Docker consists of three main components:

**‚Ä¢	Docker Daemon**: Core background service managing images and containers.

**‚Ä¢	Docker CLI**: The command-line tool used to interact with Docker.

**‚Ä¢	Docker Registry**: A storage hub for sharing Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).

**Installing Docker on AWS EC2**

Follow these steps to install Docker on an Ubuntu-based AWS EC2 instance:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl status docker
```

To avoid permission errors, add your user to the Docker group:

```sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
logout  # Log out and log in again
```

Verify Docker installation:

```sh
docker run hello-world
```

---

**Writing Your First Dockerfile**

Create a **simple Python application** inside a file named app.py:

```sh
print("Hello, World!")
```

Now, create a Dockerfile:

```sh
FROM ubuntu:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN apt update && apt install python3 -y
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```

**Build & Run Your First Docker Container:**

```sh
docker build -t my-python-app .
docker run my-python-app
```

You should see:

```sh
Hello, World!
```

---

**Pushing Docker Images to Docker Hub**

To share your Docker image with others:

1.	Create an account on Docker Hub.
  
2.	Log in to Docker Hub:

```sh
docker login
```

1.	Tag and push your image:

```sh
docker tag my-python-app username/my-python-app:latest
docker push username/my-python-app:latest
```

Now, anyone can pull and run your image:

```sh
docker pull username/my-python-app:latest
docker run username/my-python-app
```
