**Introduction to Cloud Computing:**

Cloud computing is the backbone of modern IT infrastructure, enabling businesses to deploy, scale, and manage applications efficiently. Before diving into specific cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, understanding the core concepts of cloud computing is essential.

**1. What is Cloud Computing?**

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing resources—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and software—over the internet. Instead of maintaining physical servers, companies can access computing power from cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

**Key Benefits of Cloud Computing:**

**•	Cost Efficiency** – Pay for what you use (Pay-as-you-go model)

**•	Scalability** – Instantly scale resources based on demand

**•	High Availability** – Cloud providers ensure uptime across multiple regions

**•	Security** – Cloud providers offer built-in security features and compliance certifications
