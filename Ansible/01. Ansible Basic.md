## âœ… What is Ansible?

  Ansible is an open-source IT automation tool developed by Red Hat. It is used for configuration management, application deployment, orchestration, and automation.
It is agentless â†’ uses SSH (Linux) or WinRM (Windows) to connect to nodes, so no agent is required. Uses YAML to define automation tasks (called Playbooks).
