## 🌐 What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (often called K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform developed by Google (now maintained by CNCF).
It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Think of it as the "operating system for the cloud" that manages containers (like Docker containers) across multiple machines.

**⚙️ Key Features**

Automated Deployment & Scaling – Runs apps automatically and scales them up/down based on demand.
Self-Healing – Restarts failed containers, replaces unhealthy ones, and reschedules when nodes fail.
Load Balancing & Service Discovery – Exposes apps using DNS names or IPs, balances network traffic automatically.
Storage Orchestration – Mounts local storage, cloud storage, or network storage to containers.
Rolling Updates & Rollbacks – Updates applications without downtime, and can rollback if something goes wrong.
Multi-cloud & Hybrid Support – Works across AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premises.

**🏗️ Kubernetes Architecture (High-Level)**

Kubernetes follows a Master-Worker (Control Plane – Node) model:

**1. Control Plane (Master)**

Manages the cluster and makes global decisions.
API Server – Entry point, exposes K8s API.
etcd – Key-value store for cluster data (like cluster brain).
Scheduler – Assigns Pods to nodes.
Controller Manager – Ensures desired state matches actual state.

**2. Worker Nodes**

Run the application workloads.
Kubelet – Agent that ensures containers are running.
Kube-proxy – Handles networking and load balancing.
Container Runtime – Runs containers (Docker, containerd, CRI-O, etc.).

**📦 Core Concepts**

Pod – Smallest deployable unit (usually 1 or more containers).

Deployment – Manages Pods, ensures desired replicas are running.

ReplicaSet – Ensures a specific number of pod replicas are running.

Service – Exposes a set of Pods (load balancing, stable networking).

ConfigMap & Secret – Store config data and sensitive info securely.

Namespace – Logical separation for multi-team environments.

Ingress – Manages external HTTP/HTTPS traffic to services.

DaemonSet / StatefulSet / Job / CronJob – Advanced workloads for specific use cases.
